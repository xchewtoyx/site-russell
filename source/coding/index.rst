Percentiles
-----------

Some time ago I wrote a script called :doc:`percentiles/cricket95` to allow
collection of 95th percentile stats so that they could be plotted on a
network traffic graph.  I also wrote some docs on the usefulness of
:doc:`percentiles/whatis` when tracking trends.

Snippets

:doc:`qrcodes`

:doc:`qnd`
