This Site
---------

This site is using a basic framework that I knocked together to push
Sphinx content to google appengine.  There is some information on this
framework at :doc:`s2a/index`.

Percentiles
-----------

Some time ago I wrote a script called :doc:`percentiles/cricket95` to allow
collection of 95th percentile stats so that they could be plotted on a
network traffic graph.  I also wrote some docs on the usefulness of
:doc:`percentiles/whatis` when tracking trends.
