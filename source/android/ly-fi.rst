LY-F1 Android Tablet
====================
I recently purchased this little beauty on Amazon, sold by www.tabtronics.co.uk
and branded as the "A10 M009S".  The specs are nothing stellar, but for the
price (Â£109) this is a great little device.

The specs as listed are:

The specs say Gingerbread, but mine arrived pre-flashed with Android 4.0 ICS.

A few comments on my experiences with the device:

The ICS build I recieved was rooted by default; however it was not
pre-installed with the SuperUser or Busybox apps from the Play store. I don't
recommend installation of busybox from the Play store unless you know what you
are doing (more below) but I heavily recommend installing Superuser.

Superuser is a replacement for a system binary named 'su' (traditionally short
for substitute user, rather than superuser).  In the default install on the
LY-F1 tablet the su binary will allow any application to gain root access
without any confirmation from the user.  This has obvious security concerns.
The Superuser app replaces this binary and will only allow apps that you
approve to escalate their priviledges, and notify you every time an app gains
root. Once you have installed it you will need to go into the settings menu and
scroll down to the "su binary" line.  If you tap this you can then replace your
system su binary with the one that ships with Superuser.
