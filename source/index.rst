================

Welcome
-------

Hi there.  I am Russell Heilling and this is my website.  For regular updates
you can follow me using the social links in the sidebar.

This site is primarily technically focussed and the main categories are
:doc:`networks/index`, :doc:`coding/index` and :doc:`sysadmin/index`.  And
sometimes a bit of :doc:`android/index`

About the author
----------------

You could take a look at :doc:`aboutme` (very dated), or more likely check out
some of the links below.  There are also links to be social networking profiles
in the site footer.
